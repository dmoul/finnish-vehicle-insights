    "text": "Finland, a country with small population of about 5.6M in 20231, offers a convenient window into larger trends in passenger vehicles. Using three data sets I downloaded from the Finnish Transport and Communications Agency Trafficom I explore the following questions:\nThese data sets provide one set of answers–certainly not the last word–in answering these questions. If we assume the Finnish passenger vehicle market is a geographically-defined sample generally representative of the larger European car market, or even more generally, somewhat representative of world-wide trends, we can extrapolate from these findings (at least in broad terms, since country-level, region- and continent-level differences are not visible)."

    "text": "Disclaimers\nWhile the data sets come from the most authoritative source (the Finnish government agency Traficom), I cannot verify their accuracy. There seems to be inspection data missing for 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2019 (Figure 1.4) however failure rates seem to be unaffected (Figure 2.1). There may be other errors or omissions in the source data or in my analysis of it. The processes of data generation, storage, retrieval, and publishing might have introduced biases that are not obvious in the data.\nObservations and inferences are my own. A professional analysis of market share would include other sources. This is not meant to provide advice, recommendations, or predictions of future vehicle reliability. Do your own homework before purchasing a vehicle. Consult sources you trust."

I excluded brands that did not have at least 30 data points.\nGiven the wide range of the 90% confidence intervals, a relative difference in brand quality can be determined in the regression with vehicle_age only for the highest and lowest quality brands (where the intervals do not overlap in panel A). The narrower confidence intervals in the regression using median_km_driven_10K (panel B) provide a larger useful set of relative higher-quality and lower-quality brands.\n\n\nShow the code\np1 <- mod1_set_summary |>\n  filter(term != \"(Intercept)\") |>\n  mutate(term = fct_reorder(brand, -estimate)) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high, y = term),\n                 height = 0.3,\n                 linewidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.4,\n                 show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = estimate, y = term),\n             size = 1, color = \"firebrick\",\n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    subtitle = \"Increment: one year of vehicle_age\",\n    y = NULL,\n    tag = \"A\"\n  )\n\np2 <- mod2_set_summary |>\n  filter(term != \"(Intercept)\") |>\n  mutate(term = fct_reorder(brand, -estimate)) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = conf.low, xmax = conf.high, y = term),\n                 height = 0.3,\n                 linewidth = 0.5, alpha = 0.4,\n                 show.legend = FALSE) +\n  geom_point(aes(x = estimate, y = term),\n             size = 1, color = \"firebrick\",\n             show.legend = FALSE) +\n  labs(\n    subtitle = \"Increment: 10K km driven\",\n    y = NULL,\n    tag = \"B\"\n  )\n\np1 + p2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Relative brand quality in Finland\",\n    subtitle = glue(\"For each increment, the brand adds `estimate` to the failure rate\",\n                    \"\\nwhen inspected in Finland.

    "text": "5.1 All brands\nIn Figure 5.1 there is surprising variability in the count of vehicles by model_year. Why?\n\nI assume 2009 can be explained by fewer vehicles being purchased during the global financial crisis.\nDrops starting in 2020 are probably due to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting supply chain constraints as well as use car imports being older models (the most common age of used vehicle imports is four or five years; see Figure 6.2 panel C).\nThe relatively low count in 2023 is not a surprise: the data is a snapshot at 2023-09-30, so it reflects only about three quarters of sales (“about”, since some new cars of the latest model years come to market late in the prior calendar year, and some new cars are not sold until the calendar year after the model year).\nI assume the declining counts before 2016 are the result of the normal attrition of passenger vehicles over time: accidents, mechanical failures, rust, general decay, and owners purchasing newer cars as their “old” vehicles age and become less reliable.\n\n\n\nShow the code\ndta_by_power_train |>\n  summarize(count = sum(count),\n            .by = model_year) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_segment(aes(x = model_year, xend = model_year, \n                   y = 0, yend = count),\n               linewidth = 0.1) +\n  geom_point(aes(model_year, count), size = 2) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = my_breaks$model_year) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +\n  expand_limits(y = 0) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Passenger vehicle count by model year\",\n    x = \"Model year\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    caption = my_caption\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Passenger vehicles in traffice in Finland on 2023-09-30\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the market share of major power train technologies in Figure 5.2 the macro trends are interesting: diesel passenger vehicles displaced a large portion of petrol engines starting in 2005 and then went into steep decline by 2017 (the VW diesel emissions defeat device scandal became public in late 2015 [BBC News]). Petrol-hybrid and battery electric power trains first replaced diesel then started taking market share from petrol power trains. It seems likely to me that these trends can be found in many other countries.\n\n\nShow the code\ndata_for_plot <- dta_by_power_train |>\n  filter(any(pct > 0.02),\n         .by = \"power_train\")\n\np1 <- data_for_plot |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(model_year, count, color = power_train, group = power_train),\n            show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = my_breaks$model_year) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +\n  scale_color_hue(direction = -1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Model year\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    tag = \"A\"\n  )\n\np2 <- data_for_plot |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(model_year, pct, color = power_train, group = power_train),\n            show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = my_breaks$model_year) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(),\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +\n  scale_color_hue(direction = -1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Model year\",\n    y = \"Percent\",\n    tag = \"B\"\n  )\n\np3 <- data_for_plot |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(aes(model_year, pct, fill = power_train, group = power_train),\n           alpha = 0.7) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = my_breaks$model_year) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(),\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +\n  scale_fill_hue(direction = -1) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Model year\",\n    y = NULL,\n    tag = \"C\"\n  )\n\np1 + p2 + p3 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Changing mix of power train technologies\",\n    subtitle = \"All brands and power_train types with > 2% share at least one model_year\",\n    caption = my_caption\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Changing power train mix\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we define petrol and diesel power trains as “traditional” and consider only the “non-traditional” power trains, the rise of petrol hybrid-electric (“Petrol/Electric”) followed a few years later by battery electric vehicles becomes visible in Figure 5.3. At least in Finland, the petrol hybrid seems to be a transitional technology on the path to battery electric. It’s too soon to say whether there is an enduring place for petrol hybrids (if anywhere, it probably would be in the north where it gets very cold (batteries operate with lower efficiency in very cold weather) and/or in rural areas where electric charging infrastructure may be less available and people need to drive farther).\nNone of the other types of power trains gained momentum: less than about 2000 vehicles of any of these types were sold in any model year.\n\n\nShow the code\ndta_by_power_train_not_traditional <- dta_by_power_train |>\n  filter(!power_train %in% c(\"Petrol\", \"Diesel\")) |>\n  mutate(power_train = fct_reorder(power_train, -count),\n         count = if_else(count == 0,\n                         1,\n                         count)\n         )\n\np1 <- dta_by_power_train_not_traditional |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(model_year, count, color = power_train, group = power_train),\n            show.legend = FALSE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = my_breaks$model_year) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0.005, 0.05))) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linewidth = 3),\n                              reverse = FALSE)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Model year\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    tag = \"A\"\n  )\n\np2 <- dta_by_power_train_not_traditional |>\n  filter(count > 0) |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(aes(model_year, count, color = power_train, group = power_train),\n            show.legend = TRUE) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = my_breaks$model_year) +\n  scale_y_log10(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),\n                expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1.1, NA)) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(override.aes = list(linewidth = 3),\n                              reverse = FALSE)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Model year\",\n    y = \"Count (log10 scale)\",\n    tag = \"B\"\n  )\n\np1 + p2 + \n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Non-traditional power trains\",\n    subtitle = \"Log10 scale in panel B makes the smallest counts more visible\",\n    caption = my_caption\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Non-traditional power trains"

related to electrically powered vehicles. In Figure 5.7 it’s impressive to see the degree to which a set of market share leaders (Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi) transitioned from large-majority petrol and/or diesel power as recently as 2017 to well over 80% battery electric or petrol hybrid in the first three quarters of 2023.\nToyota on the other hand, despite offering hybrid power trains for many models, is highly concentrated in petrol power. Executives there must be nervous that their market share could collapse if new car buyers’ sentiment turns strongly against petrol vehicles without transferring their Toyota brand preferences to Toyota’s hybrid or electric power trains.\nTo a lesser extent Ford, Skoda, Nisan and Kia remain dependent on petrol and diesel sales, however they all seem to be experiencing growing credible electric and/or petrol-electric momentum.\n\n\nShow the code\ndata_for_plot <- dta_by_brand_power_train |>\n  filter(any(pct > 0.02),\n         .by = \"power_train\") |>\n  mutate(brand = fct_lump(brand, n = brand_cutoff_n, w = count)) |>\n  summarize(count = sum(count),\n          pct = sum(pct),\n          .by = c(model_year, brand, power_train)) |>\n  mutate(brand = fct_reorder(brand, -count, sum),\n         power_train = fct_rev(power_train))\n\np1 <- data_for_plot |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_area(aes(model_year, count, fill = power_train, color = power_train),\n           show.legend = FALSE,\n           alpha = 0.4) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = my_breaks_five_yearly$model_year,\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0))) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale_cut = cut_short_scale()),\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0.05))) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ brand) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Model year\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    tag = \"A\"\n  )\n\np2 <- data_for_plot |>\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_area(aes(model_year, pct, fill = power_train, color = power_train),\n           position = position_fill(),\n           alpha = 0.4) +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = my_breaks_five_yearly$model_year,\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0))) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_percent(),\n                     expand = expansion(mult = c(0, 0))) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ brand) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Model year\",\n    y = \"Percent\",\n    tag = \"B\"\n  )\n\np1 + p2 +\n  plot_annotation(\n    title = \"Changing mix of power train technologies among the most popular brands\",\n    subtitle = \"power_train types with > 2% share at least one model_year\",\n    caption = my_caption\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.7: Changing power train mix among the most popular brands\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Looking only at brands with hybrid-electric and battery electric power trains\nDiesel hybrid never really got going (Figure 5.8 panel A right facet), and while petrol hybrid gained significant share, it’s now in decline compared to battery electric.

    "section": "A.1 Data set: Failure rates in 2022 inspection data",
    "text": "A.1 Data set: Failure rates in 2022 inspection data\nStatistics on inspections, specifically Model-specific statistics on faults detected in passenger cars during inspection in 2022 by year of entry into service (in Finnish) (xlsx, 190.02 KB)\n\nThe statistics include vehicle models of which at least 100 specimens have been inspected. The reasons for failed inspections include only the faults that have occurred in at least 10 per cent of the model in question or whose share is at least 1 per cent.\n\n\nA.1.1 About the data\nI downloaded the following data on 2023-12-18 (Table 1.1):\n\nEach row of data is for a unique combination of (model_year, model, brand)\ninspection_count and failure_rate by model and model_year (in some places I use model_year recoded as vehicle_age)\nA mapping between model and brand, which enables brand-level aggregation\nMost common reason failure_reason and in some cases second and third most common reason\nI used deepl.com to translate column names and descriptive values. I created a “translation” sheet in the modified 2022 source file.\nIn the modified 2022 data source file I removed “\\n” from the source in column and cell values, which removed the need to manually address “\\r\\n” substrings on the translation sheet. Since I was having difficulty getting it to work in my R script, I did this in LibreOffice (regex find/replace) and used a modified source file which has “cleaned” in the file name.\nI assume “year of entry into service” corresponds to model year. This is not true for the small portion of vehicles of model year X that were were sold late in year X-1 or not sold until year X+1. A more significant bias would be introduced if (A) a large number of used cars were imported into Finland and (B) the “year of entry into service” was defined as “year of entry into service in Finland.” I assume (B) is not true.\n\n\n\nA.1.2 Causal graph\nThe causal graph below represents my assumptions about which variables influence failure_rate and other variables. The data set does not include \\(owner\\_behavior\\) or its components \\(owner\\_maintenance\\) and \\(owner\\_driving\\).\n\n\nShow the code\n#|label: fig-causal-graph\n#|fig-cap: \"Causal graph for inspection failure rate\"\n#|fig-height: 6\n#|fig-width: 6\n\n# vehicle_age is a more useful way to express model_year\ndag1 <- dagitty(\"dag {\n  vehicle_age -> km_driven\n  vehicle_age -> failure_rate \n  km_driven -> failure_rate \n  owner_behavior -> failure_rate \n  brand_quality -> model_quality\n  model_quality -> failure_rate\n  owner_maintenance -> owner_behavior\n  owner_driving -> owner_behavior\n  }\"\n)\n\nexposures(dag1) <- c(\"brand_quality\", \"model_quality\", \"vehicle_age\", \"km_driven\", \"owner_driving\", \"owner_maintenance\")\noutcomes(dag1) <- \"failure_rate\"\nlatents(dag1) <- \"owner_behavior\"\n\nplot(graphLayout(dag1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA.1.3 Modeling failure rate and brand/model quality\nThe failure_rate could be approximated as follows:\n\\[failure\\ rate \\sim vehicle\\ age + driving\\ distance + brand\\ quality + model\\ quality\\ + owner\\ behavior\\] Given the limited data for individual vehicle models, I use \\(brand\\ quality\\), and as a result, any variation in \\(model\\ quality\\) will show up in \\(brand\\ quality\\).\n\\[failure\\ rate \\sim vehicle\\ age + driving\\ distance + brand\\ quality + owner\\ behavior\\] The predictor \\(owner\\ behavior\\) is composed of (at least) \\(owner\\ maintenance\\ practices\\) and \\(owner\\ driving\\ behavior\\). Since there is no data for \\(owner\\ behavior\\) (other than distance driven, represented separately), I assume \\(owner\\ behavior\\) is approximately constant, rendering it irrelevant to the models. This is not quite accurate, since it’s more likely that, compared to inexpensive models, expensive models will be garaged in climate-controlled conditions and maintained according to manufactures’ recommendations. Thus any variation caused by \\(owner\\ behavior\\) will show up as part of the variation in \\(model\\ quality\\) or \\(brand\\ quality\\). Thus I removed \\(owner\\ behavior\\) from the regression specs below.\nMost interesting is \\(brand\\ quality\\), which is determined pre-purchase. Can I infer something of relative \\(brand\\ quality\\) given we have only the \\(failure\\ rate\\), \\(vehicle\\ age\\), and \\(driving\\ distance\\), the latter in summary statistics (median and mean) without distributions? Yes. See Chapter 3 Modeling failure rate.\nNote that it’s likely that information about \\(brand\\ quality\\) and \\(model\\ quality\\) is baked into the ratios of new and used model prices. It would be possible to collect prices for new and used model years and include this in the regression models. I did not do this.\nGiven the high collinearity amongmodel_year (a.k.a. vehicle_age), median_km_driven, and average_km_driven (Table 1.3), I include only one of these in each model as the predictor. Since median_km_driven is more robust to outliers than average_km_driven, I use the medians.\nFirst I create linear models \\[failure\\ rate \\sim vehicle\\ age\\] and \\[failure\\ rate \\sim median\\ km\\ driven\\] including all brands for which I have a minimum of 30 rows of data (Table 3.2). \\(vehicle\\ age\\) is a reparameterization of \\(model\\_year\\). Each row is a unique combination (vehicle_age, brand, model).\nThen I create these same linear models for each brand, subsetting the data to one brand each time (Figure 3.1).\n\n\nA.1.4 Data files\n\nDownloaded: Henkilöautojen-määräaikaiskatsastusten-vuositilasto-2022.xlsx\nModified and used in this analysis: Henkilöautojen-määräaikaiskatsastusten-vuositilasto-2022-cleaned.xlsx"
